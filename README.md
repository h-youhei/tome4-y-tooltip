- Prodigies
- Manaburnable resources
- Vim Gain
- vs Stealth, Invisible
- Faction
- Flavor text

These can be always shown or hidden regardless of the related talents involved

- Damage Modifiers

- Melee Retaliation

## Intention
Move flavor text to the bottom. Because some characters have very long flavor text that get in the way of seeing important infomation.

Range that is displayed on terrain tooltip in base game is also displayed next to actor's name. Because sometimes actor's tooltip is so long that need to wait scrolling to see the range.

Group relevant infomation.
And color labels to weak-group offense and defense.

Color DamageType. And change colors that hard to see.

Since name and level of talents is not enough, add a way to open the actor's talents tab of character sheet quickly instead of displaying talents in the actor's tooltip.
